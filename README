Daemon-Whois

A WHOIS server daemon.

This version needs permission to bind to port 43 and uses CDB_File as
its database.

There are plenty of scripts in CPAN that will talk to a whois server,
or extracted data from a remote whois server, but if you need to build
 one for yourself there seemed to be just RFC3912 to keep you company. 
 If you happen to be building a complete domain registry from scratch,
then this module will help you. 

It is also a simple example of a port daemon. This code originated as
a supporter script in a module called Notice, and was adapted from the
exim-quota daemon that was written for that module.

It would be possible to improve this module using Template-Toolkit
and DBIx to connect to more types of databases. The logical conclusion
might be to also build data on which domains are being quired and hold
a cache of the 100 most popular this day, the 10 most popular this week
and the most popular this year. Obviously the best design would have to
factor in such variables as disk-access and availability of RAM.

This version does not interact with other instances in a cluster.
